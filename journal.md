The “6-7” meme, popular among the slang said, originated from the song "Doot Doot" by rapper Skrilla. A soundbite of the lyric "six-seven" went viral on TikTok, initially used in edits of basketball player LaMelo Ball, who is 6'7". It gained traction after a video of a kid yelling "6-7" with a specific hand gesture at a basketball game spread widely. The phrase has since become an absurd, meaningless response to any question, from a joke to a real-life answer. Its nonsensical nature is central to the humor.

A self-driving car might fail to recognize a stopped school bus with its stop sign extended due to various environmental and software challenges. Bright sunlight or glare could obstruct camera visibility of the stop sign, while heavy rain or snow might interfere with LiDAR and radar sensor performance, effectively "hiding" the critical visual cues. The car's AI might also misinterpret the stop sign if it is partially obscured by foliage or another vehicle, or if the bus is parked in an unusual, unexpected location not covered by training data.

We should not eat or drink and should clean up after ourselves is because we don't anything to break or malfunction and will cause major holes in your wallet. and that we would want to look professional when we try to clean up around us so that we can take care for ourselves when we are in the real world.
It would be bad to have drinks or food around these computers because it may cause for it to not work or just malfunction. With having a soda can near a computer it will spill and would cause sticky keys or pc will be malfunction and not work at all, and if it is a school computer/laptop; will burn a hole in your wallet. Also will cost money to have a new one and repair one to get fix and would clean it all out. We should not eat chips and would cause crumbs so that the keys would not work anymore and probably will have to get it replace.
If the place looks all clean;then we would look professional for people to see who you are.
