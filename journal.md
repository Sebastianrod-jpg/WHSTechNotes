The “6-7” meme, popular among the slang said, originated from the song "Doot Doot" by rapper Skrilla. A soundbite of the lyric "six-seven" went viral on TikTok, initially used in edits of basketball player LaMelo Ball, who is 6'7". It gained traction after a video of a kid yelling "6-7" with a specific hand gesture at a basketball game spread widely. The phrase has since become an absurd, meaningless response to any question, from a joke to a real-life answer. Its nonsensical nature is central to the humor.

Bright sunlight or glare could obstruct camera visibility of the stop sign, while heavy rain or snow might interfere with LiDAR and radar sensor performance, effectively "hiding" the critical visual cues. The car's AI might also misinterpret the stop sign if it is partially obscured by foliage or another vehicle, or if the bus is parked in an unusual, unexpected location not covered by training data.
